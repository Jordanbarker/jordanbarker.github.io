    "# Steps to Assess Statistical Significance:\n",
    "1. Formulate Hypotheses:\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis (H0): there is no effect, and any observed results are due to random chance.\n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): there is a real effect or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose a Significance Level (Î±): The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error). Commonly 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select an Appropriate Statistical Test: Common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the Test Statistic and P-value\n",

    "# Common Statstical Tests\n",
    "### 1. T-tests\n",
    "**Purpose** : Compare the means of two groups. <br>\n",
    "**Assumptions**: Normal distribution of data, equal variances between groups, and independence of observations.<br>\n",
    "**Types**: <br>\n",
    "    - Independent (Two-sample) T-test: Compares the means of two independent groups (e.g., comparing the heights of men and women). <br>\n",
    "    - Paired (Dependent) T-test: Compares the means of two related groups (e.g., comparing the weights of individuals before and after a diet).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Chi-square Tests:\n",
    "**Purpose**: Test the relationship between categorical variables. <br>\n",
    "**Assumptions**: Assumes a sufficient sample size (expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5) and independence of observations. <br>\n",
    "**Types**: <br>\n",
    "    - Chi-square Test of Independence: Assesses whether there is an association between two categorical variables (e.g., gender and voting preference). <br>\n",
    "    - Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit Test: Tests whether the distribution of a single categorical variable matches an expected distribution (e.g., testing if a die is fair).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):\n",
    "**Purpose**: Compare the means of three or more groups.<br>\n",
    "**Assumptions**: Assumes normal distribution of data, homogeneity of variances, and independence of observations.<br>\n",
    "**Types**:<br>\n",
    "    - One-way ANOVA: Compares the means of multiple groups based on one factor (e.g., comparing the test scores of students from different schools).<br>\n",
    "    - Two-way ANOVA: Compares the means of groups based on two factors (e.g., comparing the test scores of students from different schools and different grades).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Regression Analysis:\n",
    "**Purpose**: Model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.<br>\n",
    "**Assumptions**: Assumes linearity (linear relationship between dependent and independent variables), independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of errors for linear regression. <br>\n",
    "**Types**:<br>\n",
    "    - Simple Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable (e.g., predicting sales based on advertising budget).<br>\n",
    "    - Multiple Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables (e.g., predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of rooms).<br>\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems (e.g., predicting whether a customer will buy a product or not).<br>"
