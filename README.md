# About
Creating a website to store some of my commonly referenced notes.

# Getting started
To convert ipynb to html I'm using a custom nbconvert template.
* jupyter nbconvert --to html Distributions.ipynb --template custom_classic

Test locally with: 'live-server' or 'python -m http.server 8000'

# Future ideas
* Increase performance by only loading in the required icons https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/dig-deeper/performance
* Finish CNN Classifier
* Brainstorm new sections
