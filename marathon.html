        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>In January 2025, I set out to run a marathon. Shortly after
        registering for the <a
        href="https://madisonmarathon.org/">Madison Marathon</a> the
        competative side of me kicked in, and I upped the goal to be an
        <em>above average</em> marathon runner. I defined that as being
        in the top 50% of male runners. Luckily, past results are
        published online so I was able to generate some summary
        statistics to narrow in on the target.</p>

        <h2>AI Coach</h2>
        <p>I’ve used Garmin’s built-in coaching tools in the past, but
        the max distance for a race is a half-marathon, so I needed to
        improvise. There are <a
        href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training/marathon-training/">plenty</a>
        <a
        href="https://marathonhandbook.com/trainingplans/marathon-training-plans/">of</a>
        <a
        href="https://www.mymottiv.com/marathon-training-plan">great</a>
        marathon training plans online, but I wanted more autonomy, so I
        built my own coaching tool.</p>
        <section id="data" class="level3">
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>I used deep research from Perplexity and ChatGPT to gather
        articles and papers on various running topics that I found
        interesting while training, such as “What is the ideal running
        cadence?” or “Are warmups and cooldowns important?” I reviewed
        the results myself to verify accuracy by looking at what cohorts
        were studied, how many participants, and if the findings had
        been replicated in other studies. After review, the notes were
        added as context for the coach. This knowledge base served as
        the primer for the LLM to give it the latest relevant
        information. Ideally, this process would be continously updating
        as need data came out, but that is a future problem to
        solve.</p>
        <p>Next, I used <a
        href="https://github.com/matin/garth">garth</a> to pull my
        latest running data from Garmin. Below is an example of what
        information is gathered about my training status.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
        <p>Here is the training plan, starting 17 weeks away from the
        marathon and broken into 3 weeks blocks.</p>
        <section id="phase-1-base-strength-weeks-1714" class="level3">
        <h3>Phase 1: Base &amp; Strength (Weeks 17–14)</h3>
        <p>Mileage: Stabilize between 45–55 miles per week; cautiously
        progress up to a 15-20% increase if well-tolerated, based on
        your historical mileage progression (your current weekly mileage
        can safely rise slightly above the conventional 10% rule).</p>
        <p>Intensity distribution: 80% easy mileage (Zones 1–2), ~10–15%
        threshold (Zone 3–4), &lt;5% VO₂max (Zone 4–5).</p>
        <p>Key workouts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Weekly long run: 13–15 miles, progressing from Zone 2,
        finishing the last 2-3 miles at threshold (Zone 4, HR ~168–174
        bpm).</li>
        <li>Threshold workouts (1 per week):
        <ul>
        <li>Example: 5 × 5 minutes at lactate threshold (~7:36 pace), 1
        min jog recovery.</li>
        <li>Strength and cross-training: Include weekly strength/core
        sessions and occasional cycling/swimming for recovery.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <h3>Phase 2: Lactate Threshold &amp; Aerobic Capacity (Weeks
        13–9)</h3>
        <p>Mileage: Sustain or increase slightly, peaking around 50–60
        miles/week.</p>
        <p>Intensity distribution: 75–80% easy, 15–20% threshold, ~5%
        VO₂max intervals.</p>
        <p>Key workouts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Extended tempo runs: 30–40 min continuous at LT (7:36
        pace).</li>
        <li>Cruise intervals: 4 × 8 minutes at LT with 2 min
        recovery.</li>
        <li>Weekly long run: 15–18 miles, steady pace with a moderate
        finish at marathon pace (~7:50 min/mi).</li>
        <li>Cadence focus: Experiment modestly with cadence adjustments
        (+3-5%) during moderate runs to enhance running economy and
        reduce injury risk.</li>

        <h3>Phase 3: Marathon-Specific Endurance (Weeks 8–4)</h3>
        <p>Mileage: Peak training weeks, aiming for 55–65
        miles/week.</p>
        <p>Intensity distribution: ~70–75% easy, 20–25%
        marathon/threshold pace, ~5% VO₂max.</p>
        <p>Key workouts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Marathon pace runs: 8–12 miles at goal marathon pace
        (7:40–7:50 min/mi).</li>
        <li>Long runs with marathon pace finish: 18–20 miles, last 5–8
        miles at marathon pace.</li>
        <li>Advanced LT workouts: Alternating threshold intervals (e.g.,
        3 min at LT minus 20–30 sec/mi, then 1 min 10K pace, repeated
        for 30–40 min).</li>
        <li>Warm-up and cooldown protocols: Include structured dynamic
        warm-ups before harder runs to reduce injury risk
        significantly.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="phase-4-peak-taper-weeks-31" class="level3">
        <h3>Phase 4: Peak &amp; Taper (Weeks 3–1)</h3>
        <p>Mileage: Gradual reduction, 3-week taper (~75%, 50%, and 30%
        of peak mileage).</p>
        <p>Intensity distribution: Short, quality sessions maintaining
        intensity; mostly recovery runs.</p>
        <p>Key workouts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Reduced-length marathon pace runs: 4–6 miles at goal
        marathon pace.</li>
        <li>Final tune-up threshold workout (about 10 days before race):
        3 × 1 mile at threshold pace, 2 min jog recovery.</li>
        <li>Taper duration: Short (7–10 days of reduced load) aligns
        with elite practice and scientific recommendations for optimal
        freshness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Physiological Targets</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Improve lactate threshold closer to 90%+ of HR_max, which is
        a primary factor for marathon performance.</li>
        <li>Include VO₂ max sessions sparingly (once every 10–14 days)
        to maintain top-end aerobic power.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Weekly Structure (Typical Example):</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Monday: Easy recovery run (Zone 1–2, 4–6 mi)</li>
        <li>Tuesday: Threshold/Cruise intervals (total ~8–10 mi)</li>
        <li>Wednesday: Easy/moderate run (Zone 2, 6–8 mi)</li>
        <li>Thursday: Rest or cross-train/active recovery</li>
        <li>Friday: Marathon pace or tempo run (6–12 mi total)</li>
        <li>Saturday: Easy/moderate run (5–7 mi)</li>
        <li>Sunday: Long run (13–20 mi, progressive structure)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warmups and Cooldowns</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Consistent dynamic warm-ups are scientifically supported for
        reducing injury and improving performance; active cooldowns are
        optional but beneficial for recovery and lactate clearance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Monitoring &amp; Adjustments</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Monitor heart rate closely during threshold and marathon
        pace efforts. Aim for lactate threshold HR (currently ~174 bpm)
        during threshold workouts.</li>
        <li>Adapt training based on RPE and fatigue; be flexible rather
        than strictly adherent to mileage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Considerations for Cadence</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Aim for slight optimization (individual-dependent),
        potentially increasing running economy by experimenting
        incrementally during easy/moderate runs.</li>

        <h3>Workout Creation</h3>
        <p>With the LLM primed with the latest running research and my
        current training status, I had it generate my workouts on a
        weekly basis. The workouts were sent to my Garmin account via
        their API so that I could follow along easily. Here is an
        example of a workout that was generated through this
        process:</p>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>It’s useful to note the biggest downsides of using an AI
        coach compared to what an expert human coach could provide. Here
        are a few that stood out to me:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>LLMs are <a
        href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13548">Sycophantic</a>. They
        will tell you what you want to hear, which is obviously not a
        trait of a great coach.</li>
        <li>Reactive assistence. If you do not know what to ask, the LLM
        cannot help you. A real coach can probe and provide guidance
        proactively.</li>
        <li>Input is entirely text based. Running form is essential; and
        ideally it would be monitored throughout training. Visual
        feedback would help spot weaknesses or early injuries.</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">Garbage
        in, garbage out</a>. This whole thing relies on Garmin having
        accurate data. My lactate threshold prediction on Garmin
        remained the same for the last 8 months of training, which I am
        now confident is incorrect, but it took months to realize.
        Unfortunately, lactate threshold is one of the most important
        predictors of marathon performance, and key to accurate workout
        programming.</li>

        <h2>My Experience and Recommendations</h2>
        <p>I placed in the top ~10% of male participants! I saw
        tremendous improvement this year as I steadily increase mileage.
        I went from running 25 miles per month to 250. Below are more
        details about my experience and some of the learnings picked up
        along the way.</p>
        <section id="shoes" class="level3">
        <h3>Shoes</h3>
        <p>I stuck with New Balance for some consistency and because
        since they had a sale on wide-toebox shoes. Here is my running
        shoe history for the year:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Fresh Foam 680v8 4E for $68.56, retired at 688.7 miles<br />
        </li>
        <li>Fresh Foam 680v8 4E for $63.99, retired at 442.4 miles<br />
        </li>
        <li>Fresh Foam X Kaiha Road 4E for $83.69, still using at 300+
        miles, but they lost the ‘pop’</li>
        <li>Fresh Foam X 880 v15 4E for $150 - full retail price sadly
        since I bought last minute in person</li>
        </ol>
        <figure>
        <img src="Assets/marathon/shoes.png"
        alt="Running shoes, newest to oldest" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Running shoes, newest to
        oldest</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The typical recommendation is to retire shoes after 300–500
        miles. You can still get use out of older shoes, but the risk of
        injury increases. My second pair of shoes were retired 250 miles
        sooner than the previous pair due to a shin splint injury. I
        used <a
        href="https://runrepeat.com/guides/best-shin-splints-running-shoes#shin-splints-and-running">RunRepeat.com’s
        blog on shoes for shin splints</a> to pick the third pair after
        that.</p>
        <p>Carbon Plates - Expensive and completely optional,
        carbon-fiber plated shoes can give a 2–3% improvement on race
        time. Unfortunately, they don’t last as long as standard shoes.
        The “pop” diminishes after about 100 to 140 miles so you need to
        be strategic about breaking them in. Due to the durability
        limitations, it’s generally advised to just wear them for
        marathon-pace efforts about 4 weeks prior to the race, as well
        as a long distance run (&gt;10 miles) two weeks prior to the
        race. I ended up opting out on carbon plates since I was already
        ahead of my goal, and the improvement wouldn’t have made enough
        of a difference for me.</p>

        <section id="diet" class="level3">
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>The best marathoners train their gut as much as their legs.
        Consider practicing run nutrition for any runs longer than 75
        mins. It increases recovery, delays fatigue, improves GI
        distress, and helps with training adaptations.</p>
        <p>Natural sources and commercial products both work well. Both
        can cause GI discomfort, and both should be incorporated at easy
        efforts and hard efforts multiple times. Natural sources (dates,
        bananas, applesauce) can be more challenging to carry, so is it
        realistic outside of training?</p>
        <p>Practice your long run pre-fueling strategy. Find something
        for almost all long runs and use it pre-marathon. Do not change
        this fueling strategy on the day of the race.</p>
        <section id="carbs" class="level4">
        <h4>Carbs</h4>
        <p>The goal is to be able to consume 90+ grams of carbohydrates
        per hour. To accomplish this, you can use a mix of glucose and
        fructose.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>There is no optimal ratio. The ratio that is optimal will
        change depending on amounts ingested. If 90 g/h is ingested it
        should be around 2:1, but if more is ingested, for example 120
        g/h, 1:1 is likely better.
        [https://www.mysportscience.com/post/the-optimal-ratio-of-carbohydrates]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The carbs are typically a mix of glucose and fructose in
        roughly a 2:1 ratio. I started training with plain old
        granulated sugar, which has a 1:1 ratio.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Similar metabolic effects can be achieved via the ingestion
        of sucrose […] because intestinal absorption is unlikely to be
        limited by sucrose hydrolysis.”
        [https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/4/344]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I made my own running gel/juice to get 90g/hr. I added 60g
        granulated sugar + 30g maltodextrin and added water as needed. I
        prefer a more watery mix than normal gels. I also typically add
        100mg of caffeine and 200mg of l-theanine and electrolytes like
        LMNT.</p>

        <h3>Injuries</h3>
        <p>Running injuries are extremely common in marathon runners.
        Higher training volumes generally increases the injury risk
        among runners with amateuers being more susceptible to injuries
        as they increase mileage and are less likely to follow proper a
        strength training program.</p>
        <blockquote>
        “Out of 300 runners, 126 (42%) reported at least one injury
        during the training period. The most common injuries included
        medial tibial stress syndrome (24%), iliotibial band syndrome
        (19%), and plantar fasciitis (15%). Injury incidence was
        significantly higher in runners exceeding 50 km/week without
        strength training (p=0.03). Participants who followed structured
        warm-up and strength training routines had a 35% lower injury
