        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>I set out to run an above average marathon. I defined that as
        being in the top 50% of male runners, and luckily, <a
        href="https://madisonmarathon.org/">Madison Marathon</a>
        publishes past results online, so I was able to scrap this and
        generate some summary statistics to narrow in on the target.</p>

        <h2>AI Coach</h2>
        <p>I’ve used Garmin’s built-in coaching tools in the past, but
        the max distance for a race is a half-marathon, so I needed to
        look elsewhere.</p>
        <p>I built my own coaching tool by gathering marathon training
        articles and papers to give an LLM the latest context. With that
        primer, I passed it my latest running data and got personalized
        workouts.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of a workout that was generated through
        this process:</p>

        <section id="shoes" class="level2">
        <h2>Shoes</h2>
        <p>Here is my running shoe history for the year:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Fresh Foam 680v8 for $68.56, retired at 688.7 miles<br />
        </li>
        <li>Fresh Foam 680v8 for $63.99, retired at 442.4 miles<br />
        </li>
        <li>Fresh Foam X Kaiha Road for $83.69</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The typical recommendation is to retire shoes after 300–500
        miles. You can still get use out of older shoes, but the risk of
        injury increases. My second pair of shoes were retired 250 miles
        sooner than the previous pair due to a shin splint injury.</p>
        <p><a
        href="https://runrepeat.com/guides/best-shin-splints-running-shoes#shin-splints-and-running">RunRepeat.com’s
        blog on shoes for shin splints</a></p>
        <section id="carbon-plates" class="level3">
        <h3>Carbon Plates</h3>
        <p>Expensive and completely optional, I opted for race shoes
        that had carbon-fiber plates to get the 2–3% improvement on race
        time. Unfortunately, they don’t last as long as standard shoes.
        The “pop” diminishes after about 100 to 140 miles so you need to
        be strategic about breaking them in. I utilized them for some
        marathon-pace efforts about 4 weeks prior to the race, as well
        as a long distance run (&gt;10 miles) two weeks prior to the
        race.</p>

        <section id="diet" class="level2">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Elite marathoners train their gut as much as their legs. The
        goal is to be able to consume 60–90+ grams of carbohydrates per
        hour.</p>
        <p>Consider run nutrition for anything above 75 mins. It
        increases recovery, delays fatigue, improves GI distress, and
        helps with training adaptations.</p>
        <p>Natural sources and commercial products both work well. Both
        can cause GI discomfort, and both should be incorporated at easy
        efforts and hard efforts multiple times. Natural sources can be
        more challenging to carry, so is it realistic outside of
        training? Dates, bananas, applesauce.</p>
        <p>Practice your long run pre-fueling strategy. Find something
        for almost all long runs and use it pre-marathon. Do not change
        this fueling strategy on the day of the race.</p>
        <section id="hydration" class="level3">
        <h3>Hydration</h3>
        <p>For water intake, “drink to thirst” will usually suffice. If
        you want to get more precise, cooler conditions call for ~0.4
        L/h, while hot weather is about ~0.8 L/h or more.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="electrolytes" class="level3">
        <h3>Electrolytes</h3>
        <p>This is largely individual dependent as well as race
        conditions. I targeted 600 mg of sodium per hour and made my
        electrolyte mix at home following <a
        href="https://drinklmnt.com/pages/ingredients#facts">LMNT’s
        recipe</a>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>2,500 mg sodium chloride (for 1,000 mg sodium)<br />
        </li>
        <li>385 mg potassium chloride (for 200 mg potassium)<br />
        </li>
        <li>390 mg magnesium malate <strong>or</strong> 265 mg
        di-magnesium malate (for 60 mg magnesium)</li>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="carbs" class="level3">
        <h3>Carbs</h3>
        <p>The carbs are typically a mix of glucose and fructose in
        roughly a 2:1 ratio. I started training with plain old
        granulated sugar, which has a 1:1 ratio.</p>
        <p>I made my own running gel/juice to get 90g/hr. I added 60g
        granulated sugar + 30g maltodextrin and added water as needed. I
        prefer a more watery mix than normal gels. I also typically add
        100mg of caffeine and 200mg of l-theanine and electrolytes like
        LMNT.</p>

        <blockquote>
        “Out of 300 runners, 126 (42%) reported at least one injury
        during the training period. The most common injuries included
        medial tibial stress syndrome (24%), iliotibial band syndrome
        (19%), and plantar fasciitis (15%). Injury incidence was
        significantly higher in runners exceeding 50 km/week without
        strength training (p=0.03). Participants who followed structured
        warm-up and strength training routines had a 35% lower injury
        rate (p=0.01). Footwear replacement within 500-700 km was
        associated with reduced injury occurrence (p=0.04).”
